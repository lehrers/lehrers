- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven Lehrer @lehrers
- 👀 I have broad interests in empirical microeconomics that focus heavily on human capital development. I enjoy learning about new methodological tools and data sources from other disciplines.
- - 🌱 I’m currently a Professor in Economics at Queen's University and Research Associate at the NBER. I also am one of the editors at the Canadian Journal of Economics.
- 💞️ This website will eventually host several of my papers as well as code and data to permit replication. It remains a work in progress. 
- 📫 How to reach me by email lehrers@queensu.ca.
